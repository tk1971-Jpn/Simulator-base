### This file contains Blender data that serves as a blueprint for creating a metal base for a surgical training simulator.

The metal plate measures 300 Ã— 400 mm with a thickness of 15 mm and is designed with holes spaced 30 mm apart to accommodate cylindrical shafts. The shafts, with a diameter of 15 mm, are available in lengths of 50 mm, 100 mm, 200 mm, and 300 mm. 

By designing components to attach to this base, it becomes possible to accurately recreate a surgical simulator designed in VR space in the real world while maintaining spatial coordinates.
